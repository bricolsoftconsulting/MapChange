MAPCHANGE
=========

What is MapChange?
---------------------
MapChange is an Android app that shows how to extend Google Maps' MapView class to get notifications when the map has been panned, zoomed or both.


Installation
------------
To setup this project:

1. Download a copy of this code.
1. Edit the `apikeys.xml` file in `/res/values` to add your Google Maps API Key on this line:

    `google_maps_api_key="ENTER_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE"`

Usage
-----
Pan, zoom or pinch the map. The app will tell you what you just did (panned, zoomed or both).


Project structure
-----------------
There is a library project named `MapChangeLibrary` which can be used with other applications.
The sample application named `MapChangeSample` shows how to integrate the functionality of the library.

IDEs
----
The projects have been set up to work with common IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ or Android Studio.


Maven
-----

MapChange is **not** yet available from Maven central repository. You can however easily install it into your local repository.

In order to use the library project add the following dependency to your application `pom.xml`:

        <scope>compile</scope>
        <type>apklib</type>
    </dependency>


Credits
-------
Thanks to [Dave Smith](https://github.com/devunwired) for suggesting the use of View.postDelayed instead of a timer so the change events are not launched on the timer's background thread. His wonderful suggestion has been incorporated in this code.

Thanks to [Tobias](https://github.com/johnjohndoe) for his patch to support map zooming via double tap.
