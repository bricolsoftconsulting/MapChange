MAPCHANGE
=========

What is MapChange?
---------------------
MapChange is an Android app that shows how to extend Google Maps' MapView class to get notifications when the map has been panned, zoomed or both.

Installation
------------
To setup this project:

1. Download a copy of this code.
1. Edit the `map.xml` file in `/res/layout` to add your Google Maps API Key on this line:

    android:apiKey="ENTER_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE"

Usage
-----
Pan, zoom or pinch the map. The app will tell you what you just did (panned, zoomed or both).

Thanks to [Dave Smith](https://github.com/devunwired) for suggesting the use of View.postDelayed instead of a timer so the change events are not launched on the timer's background thread. His wonderful suggestion has been incorporated in this code.

Thanks to [Tobias](https://github.com/johnjohndoe) for his patch to support map zooming via double tap.
